# ePenguin-Igloo

### What is Igloo?

Igloo is a package and project manager. It is used for bare metal (for now only bare metal) embedded systems. In the embedded world, there is a big gap between how one would write code for embedded systems between manufacturers. As of today, 7/2/20, there is really no easy way to go about writing code for any embedded system from scratch. Most of the time, you need to download headers from some unknown location, figure out your hardware interface, find the proper toolchain, etc. This forces embedded developers and engineers to spend a lot of unnecessary time on DevOps and less time on firmware engineering. Igloo aims to solve this problem. Igloo is in its early stages of development.

### How does Igloo help with this problem?

This tool allows you to create projects for supported mcus instantly. As long as your hardware is supported, Igloo will just make the project for you. It also allows you to add pre-written software modules, just in case you don't want to write your own. This tool also provides a way to debug your code, flash your mcu, and quickly switch between mcus.

##### Status Guide Description
 - Not Supported: This means it is not currently supported. It does not mean it will never be supported.
 - In Development: Yet to be released for use at all. We're working on it.
 - Unstable: A version of this is out for public development, but it doesn't work yet.
 - Experimental: A version of this is out for public developement and testing. It may or may not work.
 - Tentatively Working: Some form of this works. It just may not be working in the right way yet.
 - Stable: This works as far as we know. Any bugs are minor and should not interfere with use.
