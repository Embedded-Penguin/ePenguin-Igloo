# env-dep:CARGO_PKG_DESCRIPTION=Igloo is a package and project manager. It is used for bare metal (for now only bare metal) embedded systems. In the embedded world, there is a big gap between how one would write code for embedded systems between manufacturers. As of today, 7/2/20, there is really no easy way to go about writing code for any embedded system from scratch. Most of the time, you need to download headers from some unknown location, figure out your hardware interface, find the proper toolchain, etc. This forces embedded developers and engineers to spend a lot of unnecessary time on DevOps and less time on firmware engineering. Igloo aims to solve this problem. Igloo is in its early stages of development.
# env-dep:CARGO_PKG_VERSION=0.1.0
