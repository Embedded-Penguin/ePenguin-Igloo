# Igloo Change Log

I needed to make a changelog, but I didn't really know how to do this in a way that didn't make me look like an idiot. This isn't really a change log for code. It's like a change log for project level decisions or just places for me to put checkpoints and describe what I'm doing. Idk if this is dumb feel free to tell me a better way to do this. 

## [1-10-2021] Adding user level configurations for targets

I'm adding user level configurations for targets. They will be in the [user] section. I need to fill out some sort of extensive database-style file with all possible configurations in it. For now, I'm making a file named target_configurations.toml to store these things in.
